Parse the phase as a positive JSON integer. Call cadence_query
`{"operation":"verification-audit","phase":13,"command":"cad-audit"}` with the
selected integer. The answer is `verification-audit-1`: `sources` names each
input as it was read (REQUIREMENTS.md active declarations and trace rows,
ROADMAP.md declarations, the approved context, the native publications with
the requirements they claim, the coherent map with its superseded revisions,
and the current verification with its waivers and history); `traces` carries
one row per requirement seen anywhere, its origins, each edge as present or
missing, the phase's truth rows with item origins and current verdicts, every
break with its next action, and an outcome of met, waived, concerns, unmet,
pending or broken; `out_of_scope` lists rows assigned to other declared
phases; `report` is the rendered text.

Present `report`, then every break with its next action, then the out-of-scope
rows and limits. Structural coverage never certifies rejected or unseen
evidence, a historical judgment never counts as current, and a waived truth
is shown beside the met ones, never among them. A refused answer names the
input it could not use; report it and stop.

verification-read is a bounded index of current rows and attempt identities.
Read complete reports and observations through the verification-attempt
document identity; observed previews over 2048 bytes are marked truncated.

## Shared read contract

Cadence serves the project's process records; the project's source is read with the host's own tools. Search and read code with the host's file, search and shell tools: locate first, then read only the lines the work needs rather than whole files. Use `cadence_query` with `document` and `document-search` for Cadence's own records: contexts, plans, roadmap rows, dispatches, verification attempts and task summaries.

Process records never use file paths. Call `document` with an identity such as `{"kind":"phase-context","phase":31}`, `{"kind":"phase-plan","phase":31,"plan":2}` or `{"kind":"dispatch","id":"<issued id>"}` and no `part` to get its bounded index, then repeat the identity with a returned part such as `truth:T1`, `task:P31-2-T1`, or `row`. Dispatches serve identity, goal, context, notes, tasks, allocated checks, completed history, continuation, suite, lease, commands, policy and route. Phase plans also serve their typed goal, context, notes and `evidence:<item id>` parts. When native execution records exist, their `execution` part serves the same plan state as `execution-history`, including `round` (dispatch_id, host, tokens, wire_bytes, owner, at and request_id) and `completion` (suite_run, request_id and the settlement material base/head). The `round` and `completion` fields are omitted until their events are recorded. Follow numbered continuation parts such as `notes:2` in index order; each is at most 24,576 bytes. A `dispatch-superseded` refusal identifies the changed slot and current issued id. `document-search` takes a `phase` and a `pattern` and returns which parts of that phase's records match, as identities and parts for `document`, without bodies. A refusal's issued identity is the only address for inspecting the named fault. Main threads and workers use this same contract on the already configured Cadence MCP connection; a worker must not define or launch another server.

Drafts use `{"kind":"plan-draft","phase":N,"plan":k,"digest":"<submission_digest>"}` or `{"kind":"context-draft","phase":N,"digest":"<submission_digest>"}`. Compose each plan identity from the `phase` and `plan` of each identity in the draft answer's `documents` array and the answer's `submission_digest`; compose a context identity from its phase and `submission_digest`. No extra draft-identity field is returned. Call `document` without `part`, then read every returned part in index order and show those rendered parts to the owner before approval. Draft parts concatenate byte for byte to the rendered document. After explicit approval, send `plan-submit` or `context-submit` with `phase` and `approval: {approved: true, owner, at, submission_digest}`, with no `submission`. Drafts live only in the resident's memory and are lost on restart. A `stale-draft` refusal names the newest draft `identity` and changed `part`; read that location and obtain fresh approval of the complete newest draft. An `unknown-draft` refusal names the phase identity; create and read a fresh draft before requesting approval again.

The audit is the binary's join over the retained records and the owner's
documents as they are. It never repairs a status, seeds a row, infers a
requirement-to-truth edge or completes a phase.

Association, for the example phase: a requirement assigned to phase 13 is joined to every current truth of phase 13 through the phase's typed map; no direct requirement-to-truth edge is authored or inferred. The only edges are requirement->phase (a trace
row), phase->roadmap (a declaration), phase->plan (a native publication
naming the requirement), plan->truths (the phase's approved truth set,
phase-scoped), truth->evidence (the current typed map) and evidence->verdict
(the current complete verification). Read-only: no status, map, UAT or store
record is written or repaired.
