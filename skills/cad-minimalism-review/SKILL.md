<objective>
Deliver exactly the review the owner selected. The binary resolves the target,
retains its exact bytes, compiles the kind-specific intent into the dispatch
and records every delivery event; this front door only relays. Nothing here
applies a finding: no file is changed, deleted, staged or committed.
</objective>

<read-contract>
Cadence is the only project read surface. Use `cadence_query` with `search` to find source, `read` only with a location or file reference Cadence issued (or a named unit under that reference), and `document` with a process identity to inspect contexts, plans, roadmap rows and task summaries. Never open a project file with a host file tool, shell command, standalone excerpt server, or a path/range invented by the caller.

`search` accepts `{"operation":"search","pattern":"needle","scope":{"kind":"project"}}`; directory and glob scopes use `{"kind":"directory","selector":"src"}` and `{"kind":"glob","selector":"**/*.rs"}`. Named scopes supplied by Cadence, such as `{"kind":"current-task-lease",...}` or `{"kind":"phase-documents","phase":31}`, must be copied unchanged. Follow a hit with `{"operation":"read","location":"<issued location>"}`. For a large file, read its issued `file_reference` to receive an outline, then pass that same `file` with one returned unit name. Follow `continuation` locations exactly; never guess a range or request a whole file by path.

Process records never use file paths. Call `document` with an identity such as `{"kind":"phase-context","phase":31}` or `{"kind":"phase-plan","phase":31,"plan":2}` and no `part` to get its bounded index, then repeat the identity with a returned part such as `truth:T1`, `task:P31-2-T1`, or `row`. Follow document continuations exactly. A refusal's issued location or identity is the only address for inspecting the named fault. Main threads and workers use this same contract on the already configured Cadence MCP connection; a worker must not define or launch another server.

For the read-layer cycle-purpose close handoff, measure a new real Claude Code planning episode after this read contract is installed. The dispatch that installed the layer required direct project reads and is not the qualifying round; Codex is not a supported measurement host. Select the actual round boundaries from the host episode, then call `document` with `{"kind":"planner-round","phase":31,"session_id":"<Claude session UUID>","first_turn":"<actual first-turn UUID>","last_turn":"<actual last-turn UUID>"}` and part `report`. Show the owner that binary report unchanged, including its host/session/turn/worker boundaries, source digest, `read_count`, `whole_file_reads`, `unclassified_reads`, the four raw token components and `token_total`, and the numerical difference and ratio against `baseline_planner_median: 183000`. Missing, incomplete, ambiguous, nonzero whole-file or nonzero unclassified results are evidence to retain, never values to replace or a model-authored pass. The historical median's raw samples and aggregation procedure were not supplied, so claim like-for-like savings only after that procedure is confirmed.

<process>
1. Select. Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace and call cadence_query
   `{"operation":"review-select","command":"cad-minimalism-review","arguments":[<tokens>]}`.
   This alias selects the `minimalism` kind; the argument is a file, a directory or a phase number (`file:`, `dir:` and `phase:` disambiguate).
   A refused answer names what is missing, ambiguous or unresolvable in its
   reason: report that request and stop. Never widen a target to its parent
   directory, the whole phase or the tree, and never substitute a paragraph of
   your own for the resolved document. Retain `result.kind`, `result.target`,
   `result.material`, `result.intent` and `result.admission`.
2. Admit. Call cadence_apply `{"operation":"review-admit","request":<result.admission, unchanged>}`.
   Only an answer with an admitted fire proceeds; a replayed answer names the
   review already admitted for this selection.
3. Deliver. Call cadence_query `{"operation":"review-next","fire":<fire>}` and
   follow only the saved dispatch: invoke Task with `dispatch.agent` and exactly
   `dispatch.prompt`, passing `dispatch.model` only when present. Forward the
   actual launch and return events with review-observation and the unchanged
   raw return with review-return under the issued identity, wait for the
   durable acknowledgment, then poll review-next again until delivery is
   usable-complete or complete-with-failure. Provider work stays with the
   resident binary; missing or malformed output is failure, never an empty
   clean result.
4. Present. Show the reviewer's findings unedited - file, line, severity, claim
   and failure scenario - beside the retained target and the selected kind. A
   clean pass names the target that was read; it is never a bare "no findings".
   The owner decides what to change and does it; this command edits nothing.
</process>

<intent>
The binary compiles the intent for the selected kind into the local dispatch
and the provider payload alike:

- decision: Refute the selected decision: argue against it from the retained decision text and its retained inline context, name the claim each objection rests on, and apply no amendment.
- minimalism: Rank code that should not exist, as a deletion list ordered by severity: reinvented standard library or dependency, an abstraction with one implementation, unused flexibility and configuration nobody sets. Propose deletions; apply nothing.
- plan: Work backward from the phase goal and its locked decisions: for each task ask which truth it serves, whether the retained plan can deliver it as written, and whether any step contradicts a locked or durable decision. Return findings; edit nothing.

A decision review takes the exact decision line and the whole document as its
inline context. A minimalism review retains the named file, the frozen
directory membership or the native phase range and dispatches the one base
reviewer with no provider and no gate. A plan review by phase retains every
native plan slice with the approved locked context and uses the ordinary
manual-plan trigger with its configured gate; by path it retains that one
document.
