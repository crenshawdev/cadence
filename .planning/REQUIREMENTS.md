# Requirements: Cadence (v2.0.0 shipped)

**Defined:** 2026-07-16
**Core Value:** What Cadence writes down during a project (deviations, decisions, captures, UAT findings) must come back on its own at the moment it matters — planning, context-gathering, and debugging — without any external memory system.

## Active

`v2.4.0 — what Cadence says about itself`. A reconciliation cycle, not a
construction one. `.planning/CAPTURE.md` holds 187 open items accumulated over
nine milestones; some were closed by work that shipped and never struck, some
describe code that no longer exists, and the real ones have gone unread because
the file is too long to triage in passing. That same file is the input to
`/cad-plan`'s recall, so its noise is paid for at every planning dispatch. The
outward half is the same problem: what Cadence claims about itself in
`README.md`, `METHOD.md`, `INTERNALS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and its workflow
prose has never been checked end to end against the code. An item is closed
only against evidence from the tree, naming the commit that closed it — never
because it reads as done. `/cad-plan` seeds each id's Traceability row as its
phase is planned.

Between the triage and the doc sweep sit three fix phases, added 2026-08-07.
They are the clusters the queue's surviving items fall into, and they do change
runtime behavior: `FRI-*` the friction the user hits by hand every session,
`PRS-*` the planning-data parser every other seam reads through, `CTX-*` the
bytes each dispatch carries. They are scoped from items whose claims were
re-confirmed against the live tree before being written down here — the
[blocker] O(K x N) git-guard item, by contrast, was closed by `TOK-02` in
v2.2.0 and is deliberately absent.

- **REC-01**: Every open `CAPTURE.md` item is triaged against the live tree and lands in exactly one of three states — closed with the commit that closed it named, deleted as moot with the reason stated, or kept with its claim re-verified and its file:line citations corrected. No item survives on its original wording alone
- **REC-02**: The capture file stops being an append-only log: moot items move out of the live queue to a `## Archive` section, so what `/cad-plan`'s recall reads is the set of things still true. Closed items stay, carrying their `[closed]` marker — `planning-files.mjs:602-609` keeps them in the corpus on purpose as the prior evidence recall exists to surface, and they are only 16.8% of it. The recall path is measured before and after against a snapshot holding CAPTURE.md alone, since a shorter corpus changes what BM25 ranks (corrected at phase-1 context, 2026-08-07)
- **FRI-01**: `/cad-verify` states the human-check bar — an item is human-verify only when the model cannot execute it (irreversible against real data, or outside its reach: credentials, GUI, hardware, another machine) — and its walk runs and cites everything else as a results table, reserving the one-at-a-time turn-ending walk for the items that survive the bar. `cad-verifier`'s `why_human` field already encodes this; the walk does not apply it
- **FRI-02**: A blocking review trigger cannot re-arm without bound on the commit that fixes the findings it just raised: the cap is stated, the loop terminates, and exceeding it surfaces a named reason. Every dispatched agent carries an explicit runaway-loop bound (issue #72 — `maxTurns` is the only guard the host offers and Cadence sets it nowhere)
- **FRI-03**: Routing floors and branch naming describe the actual work — a dependency lockfile no longer matches the `concurrency` surface and so no longer floors a phase to `critical`; `git-branch.mjs decide` with no active milestone downgrades to `ask` instead of naming the milestone that already shipped; and a planning-doc version that disagrees with the shipped manifest is visible to `/cad-health`, `/cad-audit` and self-verify (issue #87)
- **PRS-01**: `planning-files.mjs`' frontmatter reads stop dropping and fabricating: a block item with no active `currentKey` yields an `unknown-line` issue rather than vanishing, `unwrap` cannot mint a value from a quote followed by text, and `readFrontmatterList` handles a comment that is the whole remainder of a key line as well as a CRLF-checked-out file
- **PRS-02**: `planning-files.mjs`' section and id reads stop truncating and mis-rejecting: `promoteUnreleased`'s bounding is fence-aware, `REQ_ID_EXACT` accepts a category not starting with `[A-Z]`, and `unseeded` fires on a populated Traceability table missing the milestone's ids rather than only on a zero-row one. Every fix ships with a regression test proved failing-capable against the unpatched code
- **CTX-01**: `cadence-core/references/**` comes under `weight-budgets.json` with a per-file ceiling self-verify enforces, and the two heaviest commands (`panel-review`, `cad-land`, measured at 2.4x the workhorse commands) are cut, with before/after byte counts committed
- **CTX-02**: Prose that rides every dispatch is stated once rather than restated per file: a writing contract (one action per sentence, constraint before the action it limits — issue #69) is preloaded and asserted to resolve for every agent, and the review subsystem gains a minimalism lens (issue #29) that reports what could be deleted, separately from the correctness pass
- **DOC-02**: `/cad-docs-verify` runs across the whole doc surface — `README.md`, `METHOD.md`, `INTERNALS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `cadence-core/workflows/*.md` — and every claim it reports stale is either corrected or recorded as a known divergence with its reason. The run is repeatable and its output is committed, so the next cycle starts from a diff rather than a fresh sweep
- **DOC-03**: A claim that turns out to describe a real defect rather than stale prose is filed as its own requirement rather than silently reworded, so the cycle cannot quietly convert a bug into a documentation edit

## Shipped

Delivered and verified. Kept as rows for shipped-scope trace; the
release-candidate tags and git history hold the full requirement text. Archived
out of `## Traceability` so a new milestone's audit starts clean (the audit seam
parses only the Traceability table).

## Deferred

Tracked, not in the current roadmap.

- **RCL-06**: External memory backends (mem-*/claude-mem/MCP) behind the same `recall(query) → snippets` contract

## Out of Scope

Explicit exclusions. The reason prevents scope creep later.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Embeddings / vector search | BM25 is deterministic, zero-dep, sufficient for dozens of markdown files; embeddings add forbidden infra |
| Knowledge / cross-project memory | Cadence owns project-scoped working memory only; global memory belongs to the developer's own tools (LINEAGE cut) |
| Live token telemetry | Claude Code exposes no per-turn stats to plugin scripts; measurement is static prose weight |
| Second-model lanes | Separate deferred cycle, tracked in project memory |

## Traceability

Live requirement → phase → plan → verified trace for the **current** milestone.
`/cad-plan` creates a row per requirement (always at `Pending`); no writer but
cad-verify ever sets a Status beyond it (`references/req-traceability.md`).
Shipped rows move to `## Shipped` above when a milestone closes, so
`/cad-audit` starts each cycle clean. The audit seam reads the rows of this
section only, bounded at the next `## ` heading.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|

Empty between milestones. `v2.3.0`'s eleven rows moved to `## Shipped` at its
close, so the next cycle's audit starts clean. Rows come back one at a time
from `/cad-plan`'s `seed-reqs` call as each phase is planned - never
hand-populated.

*Last updated: 2026-08-07 v2.4.0's five phases opened; FRI-01..03, PRS-01..02 and CTX-01..02 added to `## Active` alongside the REC/DOC reconciliation scope*
