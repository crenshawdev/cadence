# Requirements: Cadence (v2.0.0 shipped)

**Defined:** 2026-07-16
**Core Value:** What Cadence writes down during a project (deviations, decisions, captures, UAT findings) must come back on its own at the moment it matters — planning, context-gathering, and debugging — without any external memory system.

## Active

`v2.3.0 — where the bytes live`. A context-efficiency cycle grounded in a
burnrate measurement over the 30 days ending 2026-08-01: 108.5k resident
context per assistant turn against 565 output tokens, so cost is
`context_size × turn_count` and reasoning depth is very nearly free. Every item
below is a site where the shipped code disagrees with a rule
`references/seams.md` already states. The cycle is transport-only except where
noted: it moves bytes and changes when they load, and removes no review, gate,
rung or guardrail. `/cad-plan` seeds each id's Traceability row as its phase is
planned.

- **RES-01**: Executor reports leave the orchestrator context — `cad-executor` writes `.planning/phases/<N>/reports/plan-<k>.md` and returns only a digest (status, task count, commit range, deviation count, open-item count); the `summary` step reads them back once. The `partial` and `timeout` continuation branches read the FILE, not the return, or a continuation silently re-runs finished tasks
- **RES-02**: Verifier findings leave the orchestrator context — `cad-verifier` writes one findings file under `.planning/phases/<N>/` and returns a digest plus the path; `verify-deep` pipes `uat merge` straight from it and `route_failures` opens it at the point it acts. Carries the cycle's one deliberate safety exception: a NARROW `Write` grant, one file under `.planning/phases/<N>/`, with `Edit`/`MultiEdit` still denied on all four rungs
- **RES-03**: Review artifacts stop being paid for twice — `claude-subagent` receives `{base_ref, head_ref}` and runs the diff itself, cross-model receives the existing `--payload <file>`. `assertUnderCap` moves to measuring the file's CONTENTS, which also closes the open non-string-payload bypass of the same cap
- **RES-04**: `references/seams.md` states WHEN a file round-trip is worth its extra turn, so the next application of the rule saves rather than costs: it pays only when the parent's read-back folds into a turn it was taking anyway and lands late in the run, and extraction belongs to whichever side has the smaller resident context
- **LOD-01**: `references/git.md` splits into `git-guard.md` (rails 1, 2, 4) and `git-publish.md` (rail 3), so the four skills that only need the guard stop loading publish policy and hook internals. Every citation moves with it, including the ones that cite rails by NUMBER
- **LOD-02**: The triage gate lives in its own small reference rather than being re-read as part of a 13KB file three times per phase, and its adjudicated arm becomes a structured multi-select over the survivors — NONE still the default — replacing the open-ended-prose mandate that made every adjudicated review a wall of text
- **LOD-03**: `conventions.md` stops being half-referenced — every bare parenthetical citation is either inlined at its use site and deleted, or backed by a real `@`-include where the rule is load-bearing
- **LOD-04**: Whether `/cad-config`'s catalog derives from the schema is DECIDED on a measured menu-vs-non-menu run count rather than assumed. The derivation adds a turn on exactly the runs that need it, so it only pays if non-menu runs dominate; the measurement and the decision are both recorded either way
- **LOD-05**: Each conditional `@`-include is judged per skill against the break-even test rather than blanket-converted — a reference consulted on EVERY path stays eager — and every keep-or-move call is stated with its reason
- **BUD-01**: The 29 skill and 19 rung-agent descriptions that ride the system prompt of every session in every project cut to one routing line each, without dropping the trigger words that make a skill discoverable. `weight-budgets.json` regenerates in the same commit, since the budget is a ceiling and a shrunk file otherwise leaves pre-approved headroom
- **BUD-02**: `cadence-core/references/**` and `templates/**` come under the weight budget that already ratchets workflows, skills and agents — 156KB currently capped by nothing, including a 22,506-byte reference larger than any budgeted workflow. The walker's whole-subtree blindness on one unreadable descendant is fixed in the same pass or explicitly declined

## Shipped

Delivered and verified. Kept as rows for shipped-scope trace; the
release-candidate tags and git history hold the full requirement text. Archived
out of `## Traceability` so a new milestone's audit starts clean (the audit seam
parses only the Traceability table).

| HST-02 (install path proven live against Forgejo from a fully cold state; transcripts committed in the phase record) | 5 | Complete | v2.2.0 |

## Deferred

Tracked, not in the current roadmap.

- **RCL-06**: External memory backends (mem-*/claude-mem/MCP) behind the same `recall(query) → snippets` contract

## Out of Scope

Explicit exclusions. The reason prevents scope creep later.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Embeddings / vector search | BM25 is deterministic, zero-dep, sufficient for dozens of markdown files; embeddings add forbidden infra |
| Knowledge / cross-project memory | Cadence owns project-scoped working memory only; global memory belongs to the developer's own tools (LINEAGE cut) |
| Live token telemetry | Claude Code exposes no per-turn stats to plugin scripts; measurement is static prose weight |
| Second-model lanes | Separate deferred cycle, tracked in project memory |

## Traceability

Live requirement → phase → plan → verified trace for the **current** milestone.
`/cad-plan` creates a row per requirement (always at `Pending`); no writer but
cad-verify ever sets a Status beyond it (`references/req-traceability.md`).
Shipped rows move to `## Shipped` above when a milestone closes, so
`/cad-audit` starts each cycle clean. The audit seam reads the rows of this
section only, bounded at the next `## ` heading.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|

Empty between milestones. `v2.2.0`'s six rows moved to `## Shipped` at its
close, so the next cycle's audit starts clean. Rows come back one at a time
from `/cad-plan`'s `seed-reqs` call as each phase is planned - never
hand-populated.
