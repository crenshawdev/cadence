# Requirements: Cadence (v1.2.0 shipped)

**Defined:** 2026-07-16
**Core Value:** What Cadence writes down during a project (deviations, decisions, captures, UAT findings) must come back on its own at the moment it matters — planning, context-gathering, and debugging — without any external memory system.

## Active

**v1.2.2 — Tech debt** (opened 2026-07-24). Milestone-level asks; per-phase
requirements are mapped at `/cad-plan` and traced under `## Traceability` as
phases complete.

| Requirement | Milestone |
|-------------|-----------|
| TRI-01 (collect every open bug issue and record a fix / won't-fix triage decision for each) | v1.2.2 |
| FIX-01 (each accepted bug fixed, with a failing-capable test guarding the regression) | v1.2.2 |
| WNF-01 (each won't-fix carries a documented rationale on the issue, and in Out of Scope when it is a scope call) | v1.2.2 |

## Shipped

Delivered and verified. Kept as rows for shipped-scope trace; the
release-candidate tags and git history hold the full requirement text. Archived
out of `## Traceability` so a new milestone's audit starts clean (the audit seam
parses only the Traceability table).

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Milestone |
|-------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| RCL-01 (BM25 recall over `.planning/`, one-line JSON, deterministic) | 1 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| RCL-02 (empty corpus → `{ok:true, results:[]}`, never an error) | 1 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| RCL-03 (`memory.backend` accepts `builtin`, defaults to it; `none` disables recall) | 1 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| RCL-04 (cad-context / cad-planner / cad-debug inject cited recall) | 2 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| RCL-05 (recall CONTRACTS entry + tests: ranking, empty-corpus, determinism) | 1 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| CWT-01 (per-surface byte + est-token weight seam, one-line JSON) | 3 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| CWT-02 (blocking self-verify budget check, names surface + overage) | 3 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| CWT-03 (blocking self-verify agent tools-declaration lint) | 3 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.1 |
| GIT-01 (integration-branch model: `git.integration_branch` + `git.auto_branch`, worktrees fork from the integration tip) | 1 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| GIT-02 (`git.on_land_cleanup`: return to base, pull, reap the merged integration branch) | 2 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| GIT-03 (`git.auto_close` full close halting on `pre_ship`; live end-to-end run deferred to final v1.1.0) | 2 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| REL-01 (plugin manifest version bump folded into the close, idempotent) | 3 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| REL-02 (CHANGELOG convention wired into the close; v1.1 scope + `memory.backend` flip documented) | 3 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| RDY-01 (public docs reconciled to shipped v1.1 code, verified by `/cad-docs-verify`) | 4 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| RDY-02 (README v1.1 capabilities + lineage positioning; DESIGN reversals documented) | 4 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| RDY-03 (community plugin-store bar: `validate --strict` clean, metadata, README + CHANGELOG, semver) | 4 | Complete | v1.1.0-rc.2 |
| PUB-01 (`auto_close` full close verified live end-to-end against a real remote; blocking `pre_ship` halts before merge) | — | Complete | v1.1.0 |
| PUB-02 (final `v1.1.0` published: manifest `1.1.0`, dated CHANGELOG entry, `v1.1.0` tag, community plugin-store submissions filed) | — | Complete | v1.1.0 |
| REV-01 (symlink realpath guard on review-provider) | 1 | Complete | v1.2.0 |
| SOC-01 (planner separation-of-concerns nudge) | 2 | Complete | v1.2.0 |
| DEC-01 (durable-decision filter in cad-context) | 3 | Complete | v1.2.0 |
| DEC-02 (`/cad-decision-review` refute-then-adjudicate) | 3 | Complete | v1.2.0 |
| REV-02 (DeepSeek cross-model provider adapter) | 4 | Complete | v1.2.0 |

## Deferred

Tracked, not in the current roadmap.

- **RCL-06**: External memory backends (mem-*/claude-mem/MCP) behind the same `recall(query) → snippets` contract

## Out of Scope

Explicit exclusions. The reason prevents scope creep later.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Embeddings / vector search | BM25 is deterministic, zero-dep, sufficient for dozens of markdown files; embeddings add forbidden infra |
| Knowledge / cross-project memory | Cadence owns project-scoped working memory only; global memory belongs to the developer's own tools (LINEAGE cut) |
| Live token telemetry | Claude Code exposes no per-turn stats to plugin scripts; measurement is static prose weight |
| Second-model lanes | Separate deferred cycle, tracked in project memory |

## Traceability

Live requirement → phase → plan → verified trace for the **current** milestone,
written solely by cad-verify. Shipped rows move to `## Shipped` above when a
milestone closes, so `/cad-audit` starts each cycle clean. This section must
remain the last in the file — the audit seam parses every row beneath it.

_Empty until the next milestone's `/cad-plan` maps its requirements to phases;
cad-verify then writes each row as phases complete._

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
