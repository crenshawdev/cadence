// must still match that fact. Every check here reads a live document and the
// artifact it copies from - a route table, a resolver's own output, a measured
// byte count - and fails when the two have drifted apart.
//
// Why here and not in self-verify.mjs. Two of these subjects are cells of the
// Wiring table in cadence-core/references/review-triggers.md, and
// self-verify.mjs:927 records a standing decision NOT to parse that table:
// it has no stated grammar, so a check built on its shape goes red on a
// reformat that changed no fact (the failure mode lib/deferred-reads.mjs
// documents). These tests parse one NAMED ROW each instead of the table's
// shape, and they live in a test file rather than in the linter so the
// decision stays intact.
//
// Run: node --test 'cadence-core/bin/*.test.mjs' - CI's own glob, which is why
// this is a top-level file and not one under lib/. tsconfig.ci.json excludes
// *.test.mjs, so nothing here carries an @ts-check burden.
